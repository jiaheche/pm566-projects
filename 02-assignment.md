  - Missing values in asthma cannot be dealt with using the provided
    method because asthma is a binary variable.

Looking at the data (EDA)

``` r
merged %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=bmi, y=fev, color=townname))+
  geom_point()+
  stat_smooth(method=lm)+
  facet_wrap(~townname)+
  labs(title = "BMI v. FEV by town with regression lines")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula 'y ~ x'

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

  - BMI and FEV have positive correlation across all towns.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
merged %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=fev, fill=obesity_level))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  labs(title = "FEV by BMI category", x="FEV", y="n")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
merged %>%
  filter(!(smoke_gas_exposure %in% NA)) %>%
    ggplot()+
    geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=fev, fill=smoke_gas_exposure))+
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
    labs(title = "FEV by smoke/gas exposure", x="FEV", y="n")
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-2.png)<!-- -->

  - Within each category of obesity level or smoke/gas exposure, the
    distribution of FEV is nearly normal. Most people have normal BMI
    and exposure to gas.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
merged %>%
  filter(!(smoke_gas_exposure %in% NA)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=obesity_level, fill=smoke_gas_exposure))+
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")+
  labs(title = "BMI by smoke/gas exposure", x="BMI", y="n")
```

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

  - Again, lots of people have normal BMI and exposure to gas.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
merged %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y=fev, fill=obesity_level))+
  labs(title = "FEV by BMI category", y="FEV")
```

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
merged %>%
    filter(!(smoke_gas_exposure %in% NA)) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(y=fev, fill=smoke_gas_exposure))+
      labs(title = "FEV by smoke/gas exposure", y="FEV")
```

![](02-assignment_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-2.png)<!-- -->

  - FEV again shows positive correlation with BMI but no clear
    correlation with gas/smoke exposure.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
leaflet(merged) %>%
  addProviderTiles('OpenStreetMap') %>%
  addCircles(lat = ~lat, lng = ~lon, color = "brown",opacity = 1,
             fillOpacity = 1, radius = ~(pm25_mass*200))

  - Since pm2.5 is only reported per town, it’s hard to tell directly
    from this graph whether PM2.5 mass is associated with FEV.

<!-- end list -->

  - If we use the town average FEV to draw the graph instead, the PM2.5
    mass shows negative association with FEV.
